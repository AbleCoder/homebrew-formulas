## tmux 1.7 (HEAD)

I wanted to install tmux HEAD because v1.7 fixes pwd when creating new panes, fixes OSX clipboard paste and also allows you to put your status bar on the top.

To compile and install the latest tmux source run the following command:

```bash
brew install --HEAD https://raw.github.com/AbleCoder/homebrew-formulas/master/tmux.rb
```
